In this case we will simply scale all our greyscale pixel values (0-255) to be between 0 and 1. We can do this by dividing each value in the training and testing sets by 255.0.

        "\n",
        "**Layer 1**: This is our input layer and it will conist of 784 neurons. We use the flatten layer with an input shape of (28,28) to denote that our input should come in in that shape. The flatten means that our layer will reshape the shape (28,28) array into a vector of 784 neurons so that each pixel will be associated with one neuron.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Layer 2**: This is our first and only hidden layer. The dense denotes that this layer will be fully connected and each neuron from the previous layer connects to each neuron of this layer. It has 128 neurons and uses the rectify linear unit activation function.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Layer 3**: This is our output later and is also a dense layer. It has 10 neurons that we will look at to determine our models output. Each neuron represnts the probabillity of a given image being one of the 10 different classes. The activation function softmax is used on this layer to calculate a probabillity distribution for each class. This means the value of any neuron in this layer will be between 0 and 1, where 1 represents a high probabillity of the image being that class."
